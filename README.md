# covid19-world-dashbord-table
I've created a comprehensive COVID-19 World Dashboard using a combination of HTML, CSS, and React.js, integrated with APIs to provide real-time information on the global pandemic. This dynamic dashboard presents a table that neatly organizes crucial COVID-19 statistics for various countries, offering users an intuitive and visually appealing way to stay informed about the ongoing situation.
